# 1. Introduction
This file is intended to introduce a little into the task and the specific problem that comes with it. In the following, the technologies used are explained, help provided and the task explained.

## ✍Excercise
Hey,
The COVID-19 pandemic is currently omnipresent and can lead to pneumonia. Therefore, our task is to analyze X-ray images and automatically predict whether the patient is suffering from pneumonia or not. For this we will need Python, Tensorflow, Keras and our "machine learning" skills. We will develop within Google Colab.
But in order to start and continue in the 2nd step "Preparation" it is important that you first set up the requirements listed below and download the dataset.

Have fun,  
André

#### Google Colab
To perform the tasks, a normal Python environment can be used, as well as a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab. However, Google Colab comes with some advantages, such as the fact that some needed dependencies are already installed and powerful graphics cards are provided. As a result, the training times are massively reduced. So we will use it.
If you want to follow along in Google Colab you need to create a Google account. After registration, notebooks can be created under the following link.

#### Dataset - Kaggle
In order to obtain suitable data for our problem, we use the "COVID-19 Xray Dataset (Train & Test Sets)" data set during the tasks. This data set is available under the CCO Public Domain License on the "Kaggle" platform. You also need an account to download it.
Kaggle is also a good way to get to know and deepen the topic of "machine learning". There is a large community, courses to learn and competitions.
