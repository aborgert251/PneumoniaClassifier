# 2. Preperation
In the 2nd step we want to prepare our Google Colab Notebook. To do this, we upload the data set and install the necessary dependencies.  

## ✍Excercises
### 1. Upload the dataset
The first task is to upload the data set as a .zip archive and then to unpack it. The files should then be prepared in such a way that the tree structure shown below is achieved.    
  
⚠ Google Colab saves all uploaded files under /content/

### 2. Try to run the notebook
Now you should be able to run the notebook step by step. Be aware of that you need to run every code block that you have changed and the blocks where it is used again to compile.

## 📃The file structure
|-- dataset  
> |-- train  
>> | -- NORMAL  
>> | -- PNEUNOMIA  
> |-- test  
>> | -- NORMAL  
>> | -- PNEUNOMIA  


## ℹDisclaimer
Of course, basic Python experience is not expected. If you have problems with this or the following tasks, you can simply use the cheat sheet, take a look at the solutions, contact me or use the internet.  
It's not about the programming language, but about being able to understand the basic procedure for computer vision problems.
